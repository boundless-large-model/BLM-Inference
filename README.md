## üî• Overview
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision‚Äìlanguage reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However, significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital‚Äìphysical spaces and embodiments; vision‚Äìlanguage‚Äìaction models (VLAs) produce low-level actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor generalization to physical world. Thus, unified models that operate seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the <b>Boundless Large Model (BLM<sub>1</sub>)</b>, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM<sub>1</sub> integrates three key capabilities‚Äî<i>cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization</i>‚Äîvia a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM<sub>1</sub> instance outperforms four model families‚ÄîMLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs‚Äîachieving <b>&sim;6%</b> gains in digital tasks and <b>&sim;3%</b> in physical tasks.


## üöÄ Features
- Achieve cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization within a unified model.  
- Seamlessly migrate to cross-embodiment robot control while retaining native instruction-following capability.  
- A single model covers multiple embodiments, enabling cross-embodiment knowledge sharing and consistent control.  
- BLM-1 surpasses same-scale SOTA methods in comprehensive performance across spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, and spatial execution benchmarks.  


## üõ†Ô∏è Setup 

```bash
# build conda env.
conda create -n BLM python=3.10
conda activate BLM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Inference


Install and launch VLLM
```bash
# Install vllm package
pip install vllm

# Launch BLM with vllm
vllm serve ./model  \
--port 8000 \
--trust-remote-code \
--dtype bfloat16 \
--max-model-len 128000 \
--served-model-name BLM
```

Run python script as example:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

openai_api_base = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1"
openai_api_key = "empty" 

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=openai_api_key,
    base_url=openai_api_base,
)

prompt = "What is in the picture?"
image = "./test.png"

with open(image, "rb") as f:
    encoded_image = base64.b64encode(f.read())
    encoded_image = encoded_image.decode("utf-8")
    base64_img = f"data:image;base64,{encoded_image}"

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="BLM",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": base64_img}},
                {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
            ],
        },
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
